### Overview

>   The community benefits of GitHub are substantial, but they also carry potential risks. The fact that anyone can propose bug
>   fixes publicly comes with certain responsibilities. The most important is the responsible disclosure of information that
>   could lead to security exploits before their underlying bugs can be fixed. Developers looking to report or address security
>   issues look for a `SECURITY.md` file in the root of a repository in order to responsibly disclose their concerns. Providing
>   guidance in this file will ultimately speed up the resolution of these critical issues.

Building and deploying secure software component and applications involves many aspects; in all cases the following three
considerations should always be weighed:

-   **I know that I know nothing about SECURITY**\
    Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving discipline; adopt the [Socratic paradox][socratic-paradox].

-   **Keep it simple, SECURE**\
    Revisited [KISS principle][kiss-principle] that emphasises to insuflate security from day zero.

-   **SECURED day-to-day delivery processes**\
    Recurring security testing through [DevOps] workflows enforcing the organisations' rules and regulations.
